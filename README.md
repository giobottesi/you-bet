# 🎲 You-Bet

**The house always wins. We just show you the receipts.**

A betting simulator that runs the real financial math of gambling in Brazil — no moralizing, just numbers. You tell it what you'd bet and how much per week; it runs **1,000 Monte Carlo simulations** and shows what happens across 1 month → 5 years, then turns your projected losses into things you could've bought or saved instead. 💸

> Built for the **Desafio Contra Bets** competition ("IA em Campo" category). 🇧🇷

## ✨ What it does

- 🎰 **Monte Carlo engine** — 1,000 runs per simulation, every timeframe at once
- 📓 **Notepad-style results** — your outcomes, handwritten on the page
- 💰 **Opportunity cost** — losses translated into groceries, savings, real life
- 📤 **Shareable cards** — post your result with `#DesafioContraBets`
- 🆘 **Always-visible help** — support resources on every results view
- 📚 **Sources page** — every number cited, verifiable (en + pt-BR)
- 🤖 **About page** — full AI-assistance declaration + the story
- 📔 **Devlog** — the build, day by day

No login. No income questions. No identifying data. Simulations stored anonymously so we can surface aggregate impact.

## 🚀 Quick start

```bash
docker compose up -d
# → http://localhost:3000
```

Tests:

```bash
docker exec you-bet-web-1 bundle exec rspec
```

## 🛠️ Stack

Ruby on Rails · PostgreSQL · RSpec + FactoryBot · Tailwind · Docker · Ruby 4.0.1

**Pipeline:** unidirectional — controller → `*Upsert` command → model → `MonteCarloSimulator` → `SimulationResult`. CQS, column-based, typed reference values. No abstraction for its own sake.

## ✨ Future iterations

The MVP shipped — but the dream is bigger. Where this could go next: 🌱

- 🔬 **Sharper Monte Carlo** — push the model closer to real-world fidelity
- 🎨 **Richer comparisons** — pixel-art + icons on the real-world cost cards, so a lost bet *looks* like the groceries it was
- 📤 **More ways to share** — `html → png` cards, more formats, more reach
- 🗣️ **Plainer words** — bet-type copy in human terms, zero jargon
- 🧃 **Pague um refri pro dev** — a little Pepsi-pixel *buy-the-dev-a-pop* corner 🥤
- 📊 **Know the field** — an overview of the other `#DesafioContraBets` simulators, sourced honestly
- 🧹 **Contributor-friendly** — the [TECH_DEBT](docs/TECH_DEBT.md) ledger has starter-sized tasks with your name on them

Full parking lot lives in [docs/BACKLOG.md](docs/BACKLOG.md). Ideas welcome — open an issue. 💛
